To run tests:
	make test
	./bucket_test 
	./extendible_table_test

Note: This project has been stripped from a larger project (a buffer pool manager for SQLite) which has affected certain design decisions (in particular, nested bucket/bucket_element classes and explicit template instantiation)

Based on Ronald Fagin's model of a dynamic hash table for files (https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-fagin/tods79.pdf) 

The following methods are supported:
	bool Find(const K &key, V &value);
	bool Remove(const K &key);
	void Insert(const K &key, const V &value);

The table supports dynamic growth but does not support shrinking
